Name of the project: JEALOUS GODS, How to trim your flock

A version number: Revision 237

A written abstract on the project.
You are God! And your followers are having much more sexual satisfaction than you in the skies! On top of this your dysfunctional cousin is also a God and apparently gaining new religious followers too swiftly for your liking. So what else is there to do than sending taboos down to burn your colleague's followers while keeping your own minions out of temptation and harms way. 
Players shuffle their own people about simultaneously trying to avoid compromising social combinations that could be used against them by a wicked god. After 5-20 seconds of frantic movement a predestinated taboo will hit the world. The taboo will hit all people gathering in a specific combination of males and females. Repeat till one side is dead.
